	    I worked in both client service and product based companies. Last year I joined a creative company J. Walter Thompson and it has added new dimension to my skillsets. I got chance to put myself into the shoes of art directors and customers. As a result it helped me improve the quality of work that I deliver. My current role requires me to analyze requirements, projects management, architect , design, develop, test, debug, launch projects.
