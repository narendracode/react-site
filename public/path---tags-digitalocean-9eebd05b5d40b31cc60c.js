Continuous delivery is concerned with reducing friction in the deployment or release process, automating the steps required to deploy a build so that code can be released safely at any time. Continuous deployment takes this one step further by automatically deploying each time a code change is made. In this guide, we will discuss each of these strategies and how we can achieve CI, CD using tools such as <a href="http://github.com" target="_blank"> Github </a>, <a href="https://www.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker</a>,<a href="https://travis-ci.org" target="_blank"> TravisCI</a>, <a href="https://cloud.docker.com" target="_blank">Docker Cloud</a> and <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com" target="_blank">DigitalOcean</a>.',date:"2017/12/23"}}}]}},pathContext:{tag:"digitalocean"}}}});
